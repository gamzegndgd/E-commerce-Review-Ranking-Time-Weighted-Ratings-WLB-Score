# Project Description 
This project improved Amazon product review evaluation by calculating time-weighted ratings and using the Wilson Lower Bound method to rank the most helpful reviews. Weighting recent reviews slightly increased ratings, and statistical ranking ensured reliable feedback, reflecting the “wisdom of the crowd.”

# Technologies and Libraries Used:
•	Python
•	pandas & NumPy (data analysis and numerical computations)
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
•	SciPy (statistical calculations, Wilson Lower Bound)

# Skills Gained:
•	Time-based weighted rating computation
•	Feature engineering and statistical ranking of reviews
•	Data-driven insights for e-commerce customer experience
•	Applying confidence-based scoring methods to prioritize reliable content
